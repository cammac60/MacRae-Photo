## Overview

Outside of programming I am a hobbyist photographer who specializes in landscape, cityscape, and street photography. This site was built to showcase my personal photography. I also wanted to use this site to work on my UI/UX design skills by creating a simple and elegant design while still allowing for some creativity with regards to the UI. 

### How to Use: 

Once on the landing page you are given three options: Photos (to navigate to the gallery), Contact (to send a message), and About (to view a short bio). There will also be a link to my photography Instagram page where you can view more of my work.

From the Gallery you will be able to click on any photo to view it in a larger size or go back to the main menu using the 'Back' option in the upper right hand corner.

Once a photo is clicked on you can view it at a larger resolution and see it's title and approximate location. There are also arrow controls at the bottom left corner of each photo which can be used to scroll through the gallery without returning back to the main gallery page. However, if you do wish to return back to the gallery page simply click the 'Back' button, located in the bottom right corner.

If you have any questions about my work or are interested in purchasing a print please use the site's contact form. All that is required is a valid email address and your message. I will typically reply via email within 3-5 business days.
